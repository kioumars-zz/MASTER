Video clips are cut into 16 equal parts
A frame is separated from the beginning of each piece
Frames are compared with each other (1 and 2) (2 and 3) and ...
By comparing the opticalflow is extracted
The angle and length of the opticalflow are calculated
The data is grouped with 256 clusters with K-means
The number of members of each cluster is counted
An image is drawn with 16 rows and 256 columns
The number of members of the clusters was used to color the columns
6766 images are created, which are called perirograms
Periograms become a standard binary data set
I train deep convolutional neural network
Training results are evaluated
