Video clips are cut into 16 equal parts
A frame is separated from the beginning of each piece
Frames are compared with each other (1 and 2) (2 and 3) and ...
By comparing the luminous flux is extracted
The angle and length of the light flux are calculated
Grouped with Keymines in 256 clusters
The number of members of each cluster is counted
An image is drawn with 16 rows and 256 columns
Colors are the number of members in a cluster
6766 images are created
Images become standard datasets
I train deep convolutional neural network
Training results are evaluated
